- Having fixed the interpolation problem, we were able to make a number of plots of various different cross_correlation functions to test CoLoRe's output.
	- Gaussian-QSO cross correlation with no RSD in several different (narrow) redshift bands ()
		- Expect it to be proportional to GG autocorrelation * D(z)
		- Roughly matches (using value of D(z) averaged over each redshift band)
	- Gaussian-QSO cross correlation with and without RSD averaged over all redshifts ()
		- Expect difference for different values of mu as radial velocity causes
	- Density-QSO cross correlation 
	-
